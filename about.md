My husband and I woke up on a sunday morning, went to a migration agent and decided to settle abroad. 5 long years since that day and we live in Sydney now. Nah, we did not give our migration paper work to the agent. Self help is the best help even if you ignore the fact that it saves heaps of money.

Well, it did not take 5 years to migrate to Australia though. We enjoyed staying in USA for a few years. And in the midst of all this, we became a family of three.

We wish to share our experience of staying in 3 continents and if it helps anyone with the decision of leaving motherland, we would be very happy. Not that we want anybody to abandon his or her country. But we believe there is no harm in exploring a new place.

Oh yeah, we are from India. Hence theNRIway.
