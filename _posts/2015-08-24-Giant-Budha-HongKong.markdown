Tian Tan Buddha is a giant Bronze statue of Buddha in Lantau Island of Hong kong. Apart from being one of the biggest Buddha statues in the world, this is a fine piece of architecture and like all Buddha statues, there is a feeling of calm and enlightenment around.

There are several ways of reaching Tian Tan Buddha.

We stayed at the Langham in Hong Kong http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/hong-kong

You can see our itinerary from google maps with the link below

The Langham – Hong Kong to Ngong Ping 360, Lantau Island, Hong Kong – Google Maps

 

We took train from  East Tsim Sha Tsui Station to Nam Cheong Station and Nam Cheong Station to Tung Chung Station.  We spent spent some time in Tung Chung Town Centre where we had our brunch. Food court in Tung Chung Town Centre is excellent with cuisines from around the world.

 

And from there we took Cable car to reach Ngong Ping 360 village. There is a choice of taking ferry from Tung Chung to Ngong Ping 360 village. However I recommend taking the cable car as the ride is quite adventurous and the views are breathtaking.

 

Ngong Ping 360 village itself is very beautiful and gives a feeling a Buddhist Monastery. You might even get a feeling that you have reached sets of Kung Fu Panda with the architecture and fog around.

 

From Ngong Ping 360 , we took the steps to reach Tian Tan Buddha.

 

There is a small admission fee to enter inside the statue and know more about the history of the place. However by the time we reached, there was not enough time for us to explore the inside of the statue. And we also wanted to spend sometime sitting and staring at the nature from that height.

Caution/ Suggestion:

Start early as there are queues for the cable car.
There are quite a few steps to reach Tian Tan Buddha and Hong kong gets very hot even in September. So staying hydrated is important.
Its sunny in Hong kong. An umbrella or any other type of sun protection would not hurt.
Sun glasses and camera are must.
