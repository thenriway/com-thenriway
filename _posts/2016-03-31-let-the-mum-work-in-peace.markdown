I saw this danish lady rescuing an African baby boy. A baby boy who was living on streets and feeding scraps for 8 months. That would mean this baby survived on its own when it was 16 months old. How horrific is that? How can humanity do this. Why haven’t we all dies before this could happen. A vulnerable , tiny creature completely left alone to survive. But then I though , aren’t we all doing this every day? Is the society really sympathetic to these tiny human beings? All developed and developing nations now advocate for women empowerment. And by empowerment , they inevitably mean that women should work. The whole society is shaping up in a way where a family with kids cannot survive with one salary.

However , we never though about the babies that these women bring into this world. No workplace is built for women to bring their babies along. Not even the so called hap, employee friendly organizations who are ready to provide chefs for their employees. But a baby in the office is too much of fuss. And we all can do these so conveniently because these babies cannot talk. All they can do is cry . And we assume this is what babies are meant to cry. As if there was no emotion associated with this, no pain or feeling associated with crying when a baby does it.

Let moms bring her baby to work. And see how beautiful this world becomes. Our future depends on these babies. Do not snatch them away from their moms when they are 6 months old. Do not do it. We have to restructure the world and its working culture to accommodate this delicate phase in human life. Be a bit more patient , tolerant and most importantly be a bit more human.
