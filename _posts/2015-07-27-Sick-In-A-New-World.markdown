I recently read somewhere that women preferred men who can provide for them and this very fact has contributed to how our societies are shaped today.

If there is any truth to this argument , I salute men for not making “female chauvinism” more popular .Keeping aside masculinity , imagine a situation where the whole family depends on one single person and his ability to bring in an income. Its a huge responsibility .

I never have been in that situation as my husband has always had a job.. So I cannot possibly imagine how it would feel like to be the sole bread earner. More women go out and work now . I even have friends who have got house husbands .But still I feel that when women go out and work , its a matter of choice for them . More often than not, its the better opportunity which drives this trend . I have also seen them getting unreasonable queries on their husband’s job situation from people around. The default setting is if wife earns 90k , then husband’s salary must be a 6 figured one.

However today when I see my husband getting ready for office despite of having a bad fever and soar throat, I get this feeling of being lazy and not doing enough for family . I tend to believe that he would have take the day off if I too had a job. I feel that he is forced to neglect his health since I have neglected my career for so long. And my excuse that I have an infant to take care off is not good enough.

I hope to get going with my job applications soon. As soon as I convince myself that our beloved 6 months old can spend a full day at a daycare without me. Till then , get well soon hubby.
