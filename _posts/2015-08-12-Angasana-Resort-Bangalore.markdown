Bengali marriages have got a long list of rituals. Even Indian movies are influenced by the variety of rituals that we have. And in our case it even engulfed our time allocated for the inapplicable thing called “HONEYMOON”.

My mother in law wanted us to give up honeymoon so that she can tick off all the remaining rituals from her list. Well that was not possible as our 17 days of torture called ‘MARRIAGE’ made it very necessary for us to get high on some sexual healing. So we arrived at a mutual deal with my mother in law and gave her half of our planned honeymoon time.

The crux of all this is, we had very little time left before getting back to work and all we could do with that time was to go some place near Banglaore as we lived and worked there back in 2010. We decided to save on the travel time too. So we zeroed down to this beautiful resort called ANGASANA which was in bangalore.

We got a nice package of 3 days and 2 nights including breakfast , dinner and lunch. We got a nice suite with a private balcony facing one of the garden areas.

Best thing about the resort was the peaceful ambience.Food was really good and booze was available on order. Swiming pool was a good size and swimsuits were available for purchase.

So we just and ate, slept and played around for 3 days there ;). Oh yeah and dear mom in law phoned us twice a day to give all the details of the rituals that she had to perform without us.
