These days I am trying to write something like a research proposal and see if I can get an admission into any research degrees in Sydney. I mean, why not. Research degrees are after all free in this country. I guess this would be a topic for another blog. Let me come back to today’s topic.

To our relief, Reyansh (our almost 7 month old son) has started rolling over a few weeks back . According to my mother, he should have mastered this art by 5 months. But he was born in Australia. So I presume he has adapted to the ostensible “relaxed aussie way” from birth. Now he tries to push himself forward like a commando crawl. But my husband has got this weird thought that our son might actually have some motor delay as he is not really lifting up his butt. Instead he is dragging himself with his elbows. So dear husband passed me a “research paper” to read on how this pattern of a crawling can be related to all sorts of bad mental and physical conditions. Common ,we should be happy that our son is mobile now rather than figuring out “patterns” in his movement. And isn’t there also study on how your walking style is as unique as your fingerprint? This online world keeps amazing me. I don’t think we believe a real doctor as much as we believe these online medical journals today. I am never gonna read this article.

However after sitting on that though for 30 mins, I took the laptop. Just to browse the internet and gather some knowledge on what to write in a research proposal. Remember I am trying to get an admission into a research degree?
